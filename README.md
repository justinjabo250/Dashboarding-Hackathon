# Dashboarding-Hackathon

Considering a growing employee attrition issue, mid-sized marketing company Abercrombie Corporation's HR department is looking for a complete HR analytics dashboard to find data-driven solutions. The "Attrition Overview," "Employee Demographics," and "Attrition Analysis" sections of the dashboard are designed to monitor attrition rates over time.

# Case study

Considering a growing employee attrition issue, mid-sized marketing company Abercrombie Corporation's HR department is looking for a complete HR analytics dashboard to find data-driven solutions. The "Attrition Overview," "Employee Demographics," and "Attrition Analysis" sections of the dashboard are designed to monitor attrition rates over time, investigate attrition patterns in employee demographics, analyze attrition factors (such as job level, education, and performance rating), pinpoint retention strategies, and even use predictive analytics for forecasting and identifying high-risk employees. Abercrombie will gain insights from this multimodal strategy that will enable them to effectively reduce attrition and enhance the overall employee experience.
